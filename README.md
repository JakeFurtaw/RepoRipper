# RepoRipper
This is a project that I created to help me when I am first starting a new to me project that is built in a language I am not 
familiar with or that I want the models help with generating repetitive code. This allows Codestral access to your repository
and gives you the ability to query or chat the model with any questions about the repo in general or certain files in 
the repo. It all runs locally to avoid paying for those pesky subscriptions.

It is very easy to use all you have to do is change the strings under the owner, repo, and branch to specify which repo
you are looking to chat with. As well as what file extensions you want the model to target. Then you ask away. This
is a great alternative to paying for other large language models to chat with about your code.

### Other
If you have any questions, comments, or concerns please feel free to reach out to me about this code id be more than happy to
help get you started. Also, please feel free to fork the repo and add any features you see fit.
