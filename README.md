# RepoRipper
This project is designed to streamline the process of starting a new project, especially when working with an unfamiliar programming language. It also leverages an AI model to generate repetitive code, making your workflow more efficient.

Codestral integrates seamlessly with your repository, enabling you to query or chat with the model to get answers about the repository in general or specific files within it. The entire process runs locally, so you won't need to worry about subscription fees.

## Getting Started
Using this tool is simple:

Configure the Settings: Update the owner, repo, and branch strings to point to the repository you want to interact with.
Specify Target Files: Define the file extensions you'd like the model to focus on.
Start Chatting: Once configured, you can begin asking the model questions about your codebase.
This is a cost-effective alternative to using paid large language models for code-related queries.

## Contributing
If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to reach out. I'd be more than happy to help you get started. Additionally, you're welcome to fork this repository and contribute any features you think would enhance its functionality.
